Other Notes

- LOVE the way you all are working together, learning, and problem solving! 
- When you need an instructor, we are here for you. Whether it's directly related to exercises or not, USE the time during the class day to seek help. College profs usually have a couple hours a week of office hours. You have access to instructors ~4 hours a day when you are working on exercises. That's by design. So, don't wait until 4:58 to ask questions and if you need a 1:1, you will have more luck catching us during the day than trying to schedule time after hours. 

Looking ahead

Next week: Storytelling & Tableau.
