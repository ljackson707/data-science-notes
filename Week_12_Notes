# Notes 

-Use mean to determin base line fro regression models 

-Use mode for non regression models to determine baseline model

Residual - error (predicted minus actual)
SSE (sum of squared error)
MSE (mean squared error)
RMSE (root mean squared error)
Mean Absolute error

-how to now which to use?

- use RMSE and MAE for zillow project

-ESS (Explained Sum of Sqares)
- TSS (Total sim of sqared error)

1)cal r2 
2)look at pvalue (fstat)
3)do you trusnt nunber?

Thought for the day:
    
    “I was too focused on perfection when I started in data. 
    If I had a time machine, I’d say to 2013 aspiring data scientist Eric 
    “you’ve got to be good enough, not perfect.” Business decisions are often 
    directional. Here are 5 other things I’d say to myself:

1. Business moves *fast* and we can’t wait for perfection. 
    Business is often not research and can’t wait years. You’ve got weeks, so do everything you can do to make your best guess.

2. Ship version 1. Then version 2. Keep iterating. You’ll learn as you go and the key 
    part is to learn, learn, learn. Business success is an optimization problem, not a one hit wonder.

3. You can’t learn it all. Learn as you go, pickup knowledge as it helps you complete projects 
    and work. Don’t walk in on Day 1 with a toolbox of stuff, 99% of which you won’t use.

4. Lots of data doesn’t mean there is lots of value. It may be true, but it is far from certain.

5. Fundamental tools (SQL and Excel) won’t stop being important - they’ll only become 
    more prominent and key for businesses as the number of people working with data increases.”

# Notes What is Feature Engineering?

- optimizing your features (to find more clear drivers of the target varibale)
- combining two columns into one 
- breaking one column into multiple columns 
- making your features more useful 
- figuring  out your null values
- droppinh non-valuable features 

-How do we know if a feature is valuable or not
    - demain knowledge, background lnowledge
    - statisitical tests
    - visualizations
    - trial and error
    - experimemt w/models and feature selection 
    - feature importance

- ## new tools for FE toolbox
    - Select K Best (sklearn tool based on stats)
    - Recursive Feature Elimination(modeling based)
    - Manual or Automateable methods
        - forward elimination (start with one feature, then build up)
        - backward eliminiation (start with all features, then pare down)
