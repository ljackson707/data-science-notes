#Monday
Agenda for today:
Exercise time for Evaluation
Walkthrough
Modeling!!

## Notes 
- stratfy on the variable you want to predict (sklearn(t,v,test)

- x_train = all vatiables 
- y_train = target variable (thing we want to predict)

- To predict proablity use 
- clf.predict_praba(x_train)

- evalute the model by doing 
- (train.smoker == train.baseline).mean()

- make sure after you make a model on internal data, train it with outside data.

- be sure to set max_depth = 3 so you dont overfit

- try to make train accuracy and validate acuarcy around the same
