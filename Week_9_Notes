## Notes 

Questions that Data Science Methods Can Answer

    Is this new observation A or B (or C, D, or E) (Classification)
    How Many or How Much of something (Regression)
    What groupings exist in the data already (Clustering)
    What should we expect to happen next? (Time Series Analysis)
    Is this weird? (Anomaly Detection)

Main Ideas

    With classification, we use labeled data to train algorithms to classify future data points.
    The training data allows us to train an algorithm to produce a decision rule
    Using a boundary between points or a distance between points, we classify new datapoints into A or B (or C or D or E)

Vocab

    Classifier: An algorithm that maps the input data to a specific category.

    Classification Model: A series of steps that takes the patterns of input variables, generalizes those patterns, and applies them to new data in order to predict the class.

    Feature: A feature, aka input/independent variable, is an individual measurable property of a phenomenon being observed.

    Binary Classification: Classification with two possible outcomes, e.g. pass/fail.

    Multiclass Classification: Classification with more than two classes, where each sample is assigned to one and only one target label, e.g. Grade levels of students in school (1st-12th).
