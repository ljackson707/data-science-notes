## Some Story Telling Notes
    - A presentation with the support of a tool, such as Powerpoint, Prezi, Keynote, Tableau.
    - A stand-alone report created using a tool, such as Jupyter notebook, Powerpoint, Tableau, Keynote.
    - A dashboard created using a tool such as Tableau, Qlik, Plot.ly, Bokeh, Looker, Chart.io, and others.

    The 4 steps to making an effective chart that we will discuss in detail throughout the next lessons are:

    1) Understand
    2) Create
    3) Refine
    4) Present

### Things to think about when assessing an effectiveness of a chart include the following:

    Design Execution ⇒

How well is the chart constructed?
Contextual Awareness ⇒
What am I trying to say? To whom? Where?
High Design Execution +
High Contextual Awareness ⇒ Good Chart. 

# Types of visual communication

    Idea Illustration (Infographics)
    Everyday Visualization (Reports, Data Journalism)
    Visual Discovery (Interactive Dashboards, Exploratory Analysis)
    Idea Generation (Whiteboarding, Brainstorming)

## Classes of Visualizations

    Plots: points are marked on a coordinate system, continuous axes.
    Graphs: a diagram of a mathematical function, but can also be used (loosely) about a diagram of statistical data.
    Charts: graphic representation of data, especially when other shapes and symbols (e.g. bars) are used to represent data.
    Text: creating imagery through the written word.
    Speech: creating imagery through the spoken word.

### Use Cases

     - Support for or argument against a direction the company could go.
     - Should we develop this new product?
     - Should we add this new feature?
     - What will the impact be if we remove this offering?
     - When should we hire more staff?
     - What is the impact of a new competitor?
     - What can we expect if we implement this new process?
     - What are our customers saying about it?
     - What does our revenue forecast look like?
     - Data Journalism: politics, education, crime, etc.
     - Sports analysis: how should we defend agains this team?
     - Customer segmentation

# How to Critique Charts 

- Note (first thigns you see and ideas) 
- Answer (match chart main idea?)
- Answer (anything misleading?)
- Answer (anything missing?) 
- Note (likes, dislikes, wish -I- saw)
- Answer (What three things would you change? Why?)
- Sketch (put on paper your own version, then critique)

Thought for the day:
“Homo sapiens is a storytelling animal that thinks in stories rather than in numbers or graphs, and believes that the universe itself works like a story, replete with heroes and villains, conflicts and resolutions, climaxes and happy endings. When we look for the meaning of life, we want a story that will explain what reality is all about and what my particular role is in the cosmic drama. This role makes me a part of something bigger than myself, and gives meaning to all my experiences and choices.”
