Creating tables in SQL
    - will be creating tables from quarries later
    - create temp. tables
    - The table cration syntx and comands we see when we run  Lookat table info in sql pro or SHOW CREATE TABLE cammand.

        #Synatx for table 
        CREAT TBALE table name (column name, data type) any Modifiers.

Distinct vs groupby
    -distinct select the distinct values within a table value ie first_name.
        
        #Example 

        USE employees
        SELECT distinct `first_name`
        FROM employees
        WHERE gender in ("m");

working with time in mySQL 
Knowing when to use Where and Having 
Formatting quarries 
Use group by when useing count
Select statements in select statements
    - We can not use multiple columes when using select and groupby because the group by function is working on a single column and is too much infromation to draw multiple columns.
    - whe using group by we are changing and redefining our level of observation. (Changin the definition of what we are observing)

        #Example

        USE employees
        SELECT (first_name), count(*)
        FROM employees
        group by first_name; #Could be more than one employees with that first name

    - Use count to show the number of duplicates.
    - Group by allows us to use aggregate finctions on each group. Dont need group by to run agg functions on a list. 
    - Group by allows us to narrow down our agg functions on definde variables.

#Relationships

#Indexes (Indices)
- optimize queries and ensure integrity of data
- Primary keys
- Unique  indexes 
    - are not limited to 1 per table
    - unique indexes are use to make sure there are no duplicates within a column.
- Alter statement
    - used to update the table

#Foreign Keys
    - another table's primary key

#Multiple Column Indexes

#Joins
- inner join (join) 
- left join 
- right join 
    
    #Example of join 

    SELECT 
    FROM table_a
    JOIN table_b AS B ON A.id = B.fk_id;

    #Show all the titles that each employee has had over time.
    
    Select * 
    From employees
    JOIN titles ON employees.emp_no = titles.emp_no;

    #How many titles has each employee had?

    Select employees.emp_no, count(*)
    From employees
    JOIN titles ON employees.emp_no = titles.emp_no
    group by emp_no;

    #IF we have a foreign key and primary key with identical name we can do the following.

    Select *
    From employees
    JOIN titles using(emp_no);
    
    #This way give you two emp_no columns.
    
    Select *
    From employees
    join titles ON employees.emp_no = titles.emp_no;

#Relationship types 
- One to Many (many diffrent rows associated with a single row on another)
    -(one employee could have many titles)(foreign key points to the one table)

- Many to Many (many different rows on a table related to many diffrent rows on another table)
    -(one employee could belong to multiple departments (over time) )
        - when we have a table with multple forigne keys it is likely to be a many to many table
        - can A have more than one B?
        
- One to One 
    -(relationship between a usernameand and a password)(expressed a diffrent columns on the same table)

##More Joins

Types of joins

    #Inner join is a logical AND statment. Not tolerating any nulls.
    
    Select *
    From users
    join roles on users.role_id = role_id;

    #Left joins (Tolerates nulls) Takes from the left or the Users side.(All of records you star with. (gives all users)
    
    Select *
    From users 
    left join roles on users.role_id = role_id;


    #Right joins (keeps any records from table B that have any nulls) (gives all roles)
    
    Select *
    From users 
    Right join roles on role_id = users.role_id;

    #Multiple Joins (Write a quarry that shows the current salry for all current employees)

    Use employees;

    Select *
    From employees
    Join salaries On salaries.emp_no = employees.emp_no
    Where salaries.to_date > curdate();


    Select *
    From employees
    join dept_emp on dept_emp.emp_no = employees.emp_no
    join departments on dept_emp.dept_no = departments.dept_no
    Where dept_emp.to_date > curdate();

#The number of joins is the number of tables * 1
 #One to many has 2 tables meqns 2 joins 
   #Many to many has 3 tables meaing 2 joins

    #Write a quarry that returns the employee name, department name, and their current salary.

    Select first_name, last_name, salary, departments.dept_name, dept_emp.to_date as "Depatment_to_date", salaries.to_date as "Salary_to_date" 
    From employees
    join dept_emp on dept_emp.emp_no = employees.emp_no
    join departments on dept_emp.dept_no = departments.dept_no
    join salaries on salaries.emp_no = employees.emp_no
    Where dept_emp.to_date > curdate()
    AND salaries.to_date > curdate();

#10 Bonus Find the names of all current employees, their department name, and their current managers name.

#Manifest of tables

#Satrt by using your own database (so you ca write/edit/delete/whatever)

#Step 1
#start 
#use easley database

#Step 2
#lets make a temp table of current employees w/ their salary
select *

#Step 3
#Wrap up quarey in temp table

#Step 4 
#show temp table to edit (will not touch source data)
