Distinct vs groupby
    -distinct select the distinct values within a table value ie first_name.
        
        #Example 

        USE employees
        SELECT distinct `first_name`
        FROM employees
        WHERE gender in ("m");

Use group by when useing count
Select statements in select statements
    - We can not use multiple columes when using select and groupby because the group by function is working on a single column and is too much infromation to draw multiple columns.
    - whe using group by we are changing and redefining our level of observation. (Changin the definition of what we are observing)

        #Example

        USE employees
        SELECT (first_name), count(*)
        FROM employees
        group by first_name; #Could be more than one employees with that first name

    - Use count to show the number of duplicates.
    - Group by allows us to use aggregate finctions on each group. Dont need group by to run agg functions on a list. 
    - Group by allows us to narrow down our agg functions on definde variables.
